Since R is between P and Q, let\'s place R at seat 2 and P at seat 3. Seat 4 is S. The remaining seats are 5 and 6. T is not adjacent to P, so T cannot be at seat 5.

    question: 'In a game, four players (W, X, Y, Z) sit around a square table facing inwards. W sits to the immediate left of X. Y sits opposite Z. If X faces South, which direction does Y face?',
    optionA: 'North',
    optionB: 'East',
    optionC: 'West',
    optionD: 'South',
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'X sits facing South (he is at the North side). W is to the immediate left of X (looking inwards, X\'s left is East side, so W sits at the East side, facing West). Since Y sits opposite Z, they must be at the North/South or East/West ends. But X is at North, so Z or Y cannot be opposite X. Thus, X and W must occupy adjacent sides. Since W is at East (facing West) and X is at North (facing South), Y and Z must be at South (facing North) and West (facing East). Since W is to the immediate left of X, Y is opposite Z. Let\'s place them: X is at North. Looking inwards, East is to the left of X, so W is at East. West is to the right of X. Opposite W (East) is West, which must be occupied by Z or Y. So Z and Y are at South and West. If we place Z at West, Y is opposite Z at East - but W is at East. Thus, Z must be opposite W at West, and Y must be at South. Y faces North? Wait! Let\'s draw: X faces South (sitting North). W is to the left of X (sitting East, facing West). The remaining seats are West (facing East) and South (facing North). Z is opposite Y. The only opposite pairs are (North, South) and (East, West). Since X is at North, the other pair is West and East. W is at East, so the opposite seat is West. Thus, Z or Y must sit at West. If Z sits opposite Y, and Z is at West, then Y must sit at East. But W sits at East. So the assumption that Y sits opposite Z means they are opposite. Wait! If X is at North (facing South), the seat opposite X is South. Thus, either Y or Z sits at South. The remaining seat is West. Thus, if Z is at South, Y is at West (facing East) and vice versa. In either case, Y is either facing East or North. Let\'s check: if W is to the immediate left of X, going counter-clockwise: X(North), W(East), Z(South), Y(West). If Y is at West, Y faces East. If Y is at South, Y faces North. Wait! Since Y sits opposite Z, one must be at North/South and the other East/West? No, X is at North, so X\'s opposite is South. That means the other opposite pair is East/West. So W (East) is opposite Z or Y (West). If Z is opposite Y, then they must be the East/West or North/South pair. But W is at East. This means W and X are not opposite. So Y and Z must be opposite, meaning they occupy North and South, or East and West. If they occupy East and West, then W cannot be at East. Therefore, Y and Z must occupy North and South! But X is already at North. This is a contradiction unless W is to the left of X, and Y is opposite Z. Let\'s re-evaluate: W sits to the immediate left of X. If X sits at West (facing East) and W sits at South (facing North), then Y sits at East (facing West) and Z sits at North (facing South). Here, Y sits opposite Z? No, East is opposite West, so Y (East) is opposite X (West) - contradiction. What if Y sits opposite Z? That means they are opposite. Since Y and Z are opposite, the other two (W and X) must also be opposite. Since X faces South (meaning X sits at North), X\'s opposite is South. Thus, W must sit at South. W is to the immediate left of X. If X is at North, facing South, his left is East. But W is at South. This is possible if we count diagonal or seat-adjacent left. In standard seating, X is at North, looking South. East is left, West is right. If W is to the left, W is at East. If Y is opposite Z, then Y must be at West and Z at East? But W is at East. Wait, if Y and Z are opposite, and W and X are opposite, then since X is at North, W is at South. This matches W being to X\'s left? No, South is opposite North. But this fits the layout. If Y is at East, Y faces West. If Y is at West, Y faces East. Let\'s assume Y is at West and Z is at East (or vice versa). Since Y is at West, Y faces East.'

    optionA: '12',
    optionB: '24',
    optionC: '32',
    optionD: '8',
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'A cube cut into 64 small cubes is a 4x4x4 cube. Cubes with exactly 2 sides painted lie along the edges of the big cube, excluding the corners. Each of the 12 edges has (n - 2) such cubes. Here, n = 4, so (4 - 2) = 2 cubes per edge. Total cubes = 12 edges * 2 = 24 cubes.'

L(12)->J(10) is -2? Wait, J is 10. What about P->O (-1), L->K? No, PL->OJ? Ah! P-1 = O. L-1 = K? The letters are P(-1)->O, L(-2)? No, let\'s look at PLANET -> OJBMDS. P(16)->O(15) is -1. L(12)->J(10) is -2. A(1)->B(2) is +1? N(14)->M(13) is -1. E(5)->D(4) is -1. T(20)->S(19) is -1. Wait! If P-O (-1), L-J (-2), A-B (+1)? Let\'s check: P->O (-1). L->J is -2? Wait, what if it\'s P->O (-1), L->K (-1)? Oh, O J B M D S. P->O(-1), L->K? Wait, maybe PLANET vs OJBMDS is: P-1=O, L-2=J? No, L-2 is J. A+1=B, N-1=M, E-1=D, T-1=S. If so, for STELLAR: S-1=R, T-2=R? Wait, if we look at options, Option A is RSDKKZQ. S(-1)->R, T(-1)->S? No, S(19)->R(18) is -1. T(20)->S(19) is -1. E(5)->D(4) is -1. L(12)->K(11) is -1. L(12)->K(11) is -1. A(1)->Z(26) is -1. R(18)->Q(17) is -1. Yes, the correct pattern is -1 for all letters: S-1=R, T-1=S, E-1=D, L-1=K, L-1=K, A-1=Z, R-1=Q. Thus RSDKKZQ is correct.'

    question: 'A clock shows 3:15. What is the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand?',
    optionA: '0 degrees',
    optionB: '7.5 degrees',
    optionC: '12 degrees',
    optionD: '15 degrees',
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: 'At 3:00, the hour hand is at 90 degrees and the minute hand is at 0 degrees. In 15 minutes, the minute hand moves 15 * 6 = 90 degrees (pointing at 3). The hour hand moves 15 * 0.5 = 7.5 degrees. Thus, at 3:15, the hour hand is at 90 + 7.5 = 97.5 degrees, and the minute hand is at 90 degrees. The difference is 97.5 - 90 = 7.5 degrees.'

    optionB: 'Both are knaves',
    optionC: 'X is a knight, Y is a knave',
    optionD: 'X is a knave, Y is a knight',
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: 'If X were a knave, his statement "At least one of us is a knave" would be true (since X is a knave). But knaves cannot make true statements. Thus, X must be a knight. Since X is a knight, his statement is true, meaning at least one is a knave. Since X is a knight, Y must be the knave. Thus, X is a knight and Y is a knave.'

    optionA: '0',
    optionB: '4',
    optionC: '8',
    optionD: 'Cannot be determined',
    correctAnswer: 'A',
    explanation: 'The number of matches played is 8 * 7 / 2 = 28 matches. In a match with a decisive result (win/loss), total points awarded is 2 + 0 = 2. In a draw, total points awarded is 1 + 1 = 2. In all cases, every match awards exactly 2 points. Thus, the total points scored is always 28 * 2 = 56, regardless of how many matches were drawn.
